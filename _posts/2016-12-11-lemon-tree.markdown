---Lemon Tree-Fool's Garden, 1994, 《Dish Of The Day》 ---
I'm sitting here in a boring room
It's just another rainy Sunday afternoon
I'm wasting my time I got nothing to do
I'm hanging around I'm waiting for you
But nothing ever happens and I wonder
I'm driving around in my car
I'm driving too fast I'm driving too far
I'd like to change my point of view
I feel so lonely I'm waiting for you
But nothing ever happens and I wonder
I wonder how I wonder why
Yesterday you told me about the blue blue sky
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree
I'm turning my head up and down
I'm turning turning turning turning turning around
And all that I can see is just another lemon-tree
I'm sitting here I miss the power
I'd like to go out taking a shower
But there's a heavy cloud inside my head
I feel so tired put myself into bed
Well, nothing ever happens and I wonder
Isolation is not good for me
Isolation, I don't want to sit on a lemon tree
I'm stepping around in the desert of joy
Baby anyhow I'll get another toy
And everything will happen and you wonder
I wonder how I wonder why
Yesterday you told me about the blue blue sky
And all that I can see is just another lemon-tree
I'm turning my head up and down
I'm turning turning turning turning turning around
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree
And I wonder,wonder
I wonder how I wonder why
Yesterday you told me about the blue blue sky
And all that I can see
And all that I can see
And all that I can see
Is just a yellow lemon tree
